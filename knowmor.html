        <h1><big>Mahamantra</big></h1>
        The Hare Krishna mantra, also known as the maha-mantra, is a chant aimed at enhancing consciousness and
        providing peace, happiness, God realization, freedom from repeated birth and death, and self-fulfillment.
        Popularized in the sixteenth century by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, it is believed to be the embodiment of Krishna
        Himself, appearing in His name. Chanting Hare Krishna is believed to uplift individuals from the negative
        effects of the Kali-yuga age and bring them back into Krishna's association. The Padma Purana states that
        the mantra contains all of reality and is eternally liberated, descended directly from the spiritual world.

        According to the logic of the Absolute Truth, Krishna and His name are the same; He is totally identical
        with the sound vibration of His name. By the same logic, He is personally present on the tongue—and in the
        heart—of anyone sincerely chanting His name with affection. God is all-powerful, and so is His name.

        <h1><big>Pancha Tattva
                mantra</big></h1>
        Before we start to chant the Hare Krishna Mantra 108 times on the beads we should chant the Pancha Tattva
        mantra once before each round. This is a prayer to Lord Chaitanya and his associaties to help avoid offenses
        whilst chanting. Also In order to derive the full benefit of chanting the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, we must
        first take shelter of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, learn the Pancha-tattva mantra, and then chant the Hare
        Krishna maha-mantra. That will be very effective. The Pancha-tattva mantra is:<br>
        <pre><big>
            (Jaya) shri-krishna-caitanya
            prabhu nityananda
            shri-advaita gadadhara
            shrivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrinda</big><br></pre>
        The above Mantra means: I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Shri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,
        along with His associates, Lord Nityananda, Shri Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara, Shrivasa and all the devotees
        of the Lord.
