        * The Hare Krishna mantra, also called the maha-mantra, is chanted to uplift consciousness,
        bring peace, happiness, God realization, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, and complete
        self-fulfillment.<br><br>
        * It was popularized in the 16th century by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who taught that Krishna is fully present in
        His holy name.<br><br>
        * Chanting removes the negative influence of Kali-yuga and brings one back into Krishnaâ€™s association.<br><br>
        * Scriptures like the Padma Purana say Krishna's name is non-different from Krishna Himself â€” so by chanting
        sincerely, one directly associates with God.<br><br>

        * Before chanting the Hare Krishna mantra on beads, devotees chant the Pancha Tattva mantra once per round.<br><br>
        * This mantra is a prayer for mercy and protection from offenses during chanting.<br><br>
        * The Pancha Tattva mantra seeks blessings from Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and His main associates:<br><br>
        * Lord Nityananda, Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara, Shrivasa, and all devotees.<br><br>
        * Taking shelter of the Pancha Tattva makes chanting the Hare Krishna mantra more effective.<br><br>
